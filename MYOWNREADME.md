Welcome to the Student Dashboard!!!

Find my site deployed to netifly here: https://stunning-bienenstitch-3b5310.netlify.app 

On this site you will find a Student List of profiles. Each student listed on the main page has a complete profile that includes their profile picture, name, username, and date of birth. Each student profile also has a button "See More..." that when clicked gives some additional student details. When the "See More..." button is clicked once, the following student details are displayed:

1. Whether that student is "On Track to Gradutate" or "Off Track to Graduate".
2. CodeWars Scores that include the "Current Total", "Last Week", "Goal", "Percent of Goal Achieved".
3. Scores for "Assignments", "Projects", and "Assessments".
4. 1-on-1 comment section with the last comment added to the profile. 
5. Certifications section that displays whether a student has their "Resume", "LinkedIn", "GitHub", and "Mock Interview" requirements completed. When the "See More..." button is clicked a second time either a "✅" or a "❌" will appear next to each requirement to show whether the student has that requirement completed or not. If the student has all requirements with a "✅", then they are also considered "On Track to Graduate".

There is also a total count of all students listed at the top right side of the page about the student profiles, as well as a list of all cohorts listed on the left side of the page.
